oxide-qt (1.0.2-0ubuntu2) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Update to v1.0.2
    - Bump Chromium to 36.0.1985.49
    - Add experimental support for the Google Talk PPAPI plugin, to support
      Google Hangouts. This is hidden behind an environment variable that
      defaults to off (LP: #1308397)
    - Fix crash in oxide::GetFormFactorHint() on Unity 8 desktop preview
      (LP: #1308398)
    - Fix various issues in GPU related code, including a crash (LP: #1308412)
    - Set no_javascript_access in ContentBrowserClient::CanCreateWindow()
      to fix random window opening failures (LP: #1307735)
    - Add fullscreen API to WebView (LP: #1308947)
    - Set a wait cursor when loading
    - Add geolocation support
    - Add a WebView.geolocationPermissionRequested API
    - Allow unhandled key events to bubble up from the WebView (LP: #1313727)
    - Don't generate keypress events with unmodified text for control
      characters. This makes Oxide behave more like Chrome
    - Add WebView.loadHtml() (LP: #1320848)
    - Ensure we update the visibility in a renderer when a WebView is created
      initially hidden and then made visible before any content is loaded
      (LP: #1322622)
    - Build fixes for Qt 5.3
    - Display controls in media player (LP: #1326852)
  * Refresh debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch
  * Don't build with ENABLE_OXIDEQMLSCENE now, as that's the default
    - update debian/rules
  * Update build dependencies - we now depend on ninja

oxide-qt (1.0.0~bzr501-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Update to r501
    - Update to Chromium 35.0.1916.27
    - Use GpuDataManager for checking feature support before enabling
      compositing (although, there's no GPU blacklist support yet)
    - When resizing in non-compositing mode, handle the case where a site is
      slow to repaint and Chromium gives us a backing store for the old size
    - In compositing mode, make sure we composite during resizes
    - Fix a crash during resize caused by us sending more than one acknowledge
      for a buffer swap
  * Don't advertise support for codecs that aren't supported by the
    oxideqt-codecs* package installed
    - add debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch

oxide-qt (1.0.0~bzr490-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Update to r490
    - Build with enable_plugins: 0 and toolkit_views: 0 to trim the size
      a bit
    - Ensure subframe navigations that require a new window become top-level
      navigations for webviews that don't implement WebView.newViewRequested
    - Add an option for enabling proprietary codecs (ENABLE_PROPRIETARY_CODECS)
    - Build and install the l10n pak files
    - Add file picker support (LP: #1260008)
    - Add some resources to oxide.pak that were missing (eg, directory listing
      HTML)
    - Fix a crash that occurs when handling events from some mouse buttons
    - Add cursor support (LP: #1257662)
    - Reimplement Chromium's RenderSandboxHostLinux so that it runs the sandbox
      IPC helper process as a proper child process rather than just forking
      the browser process, which is dangerous for Oxide (LP: #1304648)
  * Split libffmpegsumo.so in to 2 separate packages (oxideqt-codecs and
    oxideqt-codecs-extra) (LP: #1301341)

    - Add WebView.navigationRequested API (LP: #1259219)
