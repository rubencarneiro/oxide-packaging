oxide-qt (1.1.0~bzr640-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Update to trunk snapshot r640
    - Bump Chromium to 37.0.2062.3
    - Fix LP: #1244373 - Screen blanks during video playback. Use the powerd
      API for now on the device
    - Fix LP: #1259216 - Expose WebView.icon property
    - Fix LP: #1282063 - Add WebView.downloadRequested API
    - Fix LP: #1307709 - webbrowser-app doesn't start in Unity 8 desktop
      preview session. Fix this by using surfaceless EGL (pbuffers not supported
      in the Mir EGL platform for mesa) and ensuring we always bind the
      GLES API on Chromium's GPU thread
    - Fix LP: #1312082 - Stop using deprecated compositing paths in Chromium
    - Fix LP: #1323743 - OSK doesn't display after some time. Add a workaround
      for this in Oxide for the time being
    - Fix LP: #1324909 - User agent string is incorrect in newly opened
      webviews and subframes
    - Fix LP: #1332754 - Allow the frontbuffer and delegated frame data for
      hidden webviews to be evicted
    - Fix LP: #1252302 - Add devtools support
    - Fix LP: #1312081 - Render content and handle input events directly in
      the WebView, rather than having a per-process RenderViewItem
    - Fix LP: #1330511 - Expose a Flickable-like API on WebView
    - An empty preedit string in IM events doesn't mean we should do a commit.
      Fixes an issue where deleting the last character of a composition does
      a commit instead, causing the deletion to appear to fail
    - Notify the IM of updates to cursor and anchor positions
  * Refresh debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch

  * Update to v1.0.2
    - Bump Chromium to 36.0.1985.49
    - Add experimental support for the Google Talk PPAPI plugin, to support
      Google Hangouts. This is hidden behind an environment variable that
      defaults to off (LP: #1308397)
    - Fix crash in oxide::GetFormFactorHint() on Unity 8 desktop preview
      (LP: #1308398)
    - Fix various issues in GPU related code, including a crash (LP: #1308412)

      characters. This makes Oxide behave more like Chrome
    - Add WebView.loadHtml() (LP: #1320848)
    - Ensure we update the visibility in a renderer when a WebView is created
      initially hidden and then made visible before any content is loaded
      (LP: #1322622)
    - Build fixes for Qt 5.3
    - Display controls in media player (LP: #1326852)
  * Refresh debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch

oxide-qt (1.0.0~bzr501-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Update to r501
    - Update to Chromium 35.0.1916.27
    - Use GpuDataManager for checking feature support before enabling
      compositing (although, there's no GPU blacklist support yet)
    - When resizing in non-compositing mode, handle the case where a site is
      slow to repaint and Chromium gives us a backing store for the old size
    - In compositing mode, make sure we composite during resizes
    - Fix a crash during resize caused by us sending more than one acknowledge
      for a buffer swap
  * Don't advertise support for codecs that aren't supported by the
    oxideqt-codecs* package installed
    - add debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch

oxide-qt (1.0.0~bzr490-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Update to r490
    - Build with enable_plugins: 0 and toolkit_views: 0 to trim the size
      a bit
    - Ensure subframe navigations that require a new window become top-level
      navigations for webviews that don't implement WebView.newViewRequested
    - Add an option for enabling proprietary codecs (ENABLE_PROPRIETARY_CODECS)
    - Build and install the l10n pak files

      HTML)
    - Fix a crash that occurs when handling events from some mouse buttons
    - Add cursor support (LP: #1257662)
    - Reimplement Chromium's RenderSandboxHostLinux so that it runs the sandbox
      IPC helper process as a proper child process rather than just forking
      the browser process, which is dangerous for Oxide (LP: #1304648)
  * Split libffmpegsumo.so in to 2 separate packages (oxideqt-codecs and
    oxideqt-codecs-extra) (LP: #1301341)
